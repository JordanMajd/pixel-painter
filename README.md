[pixel-painter](pixel-painter.jordanmajd.com); a simple pixel art paint tool built ontop of SVG.

I set out to build something completely different, while debugging my son caught me clicking on elements to change their color and wanted to try it out. From there it evolved into this.


## Up and Running

Zero dependencies, just need to clone and serve the files.

```sh
# clone repo
git clone git@github.com:JordanMajd/pixel-painter.git
# host on localhost:8000
python -m http.server 
```
